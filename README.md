## How to Run Our Code
Step 1: Set up the mininet environment and ensure that you can connect from the host PC to the guest VM via SSH.
Step 2: Once the environment is set up, open a terminal and run: ssh -X [user]@[Guest IP Here]. 
  - Replace [user] with the correct user name for your VM image (in our case, mininet). 
  - Replace [Guest IP Here] with the IP you noted from the VM (in our case, 192.168.56.101). 
  - When prompted, enter the password for the VM image (in our case, mininet). 
 Step 4: Start up an X terminal using '$ xterm' and a new terminal window should appear. 
  - If you get a 'xterm: DISPLAY is not set error', try running ssh -Y [user]@[Guest IP Here] instead of using -X.
